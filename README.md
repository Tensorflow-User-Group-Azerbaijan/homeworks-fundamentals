## üíª Structure

### Deadline policy 

Once sent, each student is given 4 days for homework. Homeworks handed after the deadline will not be graded. If a student is unable to complete the homework, he/she should ask for help from the teacher or other students at slack group before deadline.


### Homework submission instructions
Student should submit answers under the corresponding homework folder in his/her github classroom repository. Steps for submission:


1. Install Git  [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

2. Fork your private repo and clone it to your computer using the terminal command `git clone <url>`.  Navigate into the cloned folder and build your homework project there.

3. Add your answers in .py or .ipynb file. As you make changes and decide to commit your code follow these commands:

	```
    git status //You'll see all of the files you've changed show up in red
    git add --all //this command stages all of your changes for commit
    git status //All of the red files should now be green
    git commit -m "<your commit message here>" //this commits your changes
    git status //All of the file names should no longer appear
    git push origin main //This pushes your changes up to the cloud
	```
